# Languages
Translation files that Project Lotus uses.


## How to translate and add your own language!
1. [Fork this Repository](https://github.com/Lotus-AU/Languages/fork)
2. Make a new file for the language you wish to translate, matching the pattern of other translation files. (Ex: lang_(Language).yaml)
3. Copy the strings from another file (like English) into your file and begin translating!
4. Once you're done translating, you can make a pull request with your file (by going to the pull request tab of your fork and pressing **New**)

Comgrats, if it gets accepted then you've successfully added a language to Project: Lotus, thank you so much for helping us!
